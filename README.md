## Task
You are helping a small startup that wants to compete with IKEA. They need a simple system that keeps track of product assortment, customers and sold items. Since they want to compete with IKEA, they will sell furniture, textiles, and hot dogs.

A few prerequisites:

* Everything sold at the startup has a price and a description
* All items in the Furniture category have an item number and a weight (apart from price and description)
* All items in the Textile category have an item number and a color (apart from price and description) 
* Hot dogs have a flavor (apart from price and description), but no item number
* Customers can have a membership in the startup. Members get a discount on one ormore item categories.
    * Example 1: A customer buys a carpet and a chili-flavored hot dog. He is not a member, so he doesnâ€™t get any discount.
    * Example 2: Another customer buys a wardrobe, a rug, and a vegetarian hot dog. She is a member, with furniture and hot dog discounts. So she gets a discount on the wardrobe and the hot dog, but pays normal price for the rug.

Items, categories and users can be inserted by a sql script or on application startup, no need to manage them

The application should expose REST for :
* create order
* get order - response should contain products and discounts

## Get all orders
GET localhost:8080/orders

## Create order
POST localhost:8080/orders - with raw JSON payload

Provide product item number for textiles and furniture, and flavor and quantity object for hot dogs.
